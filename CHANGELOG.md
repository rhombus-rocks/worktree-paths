# Changelog

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/fnrhombus/claude-code-worktree-paths/compare/claude-code-worktree-paths-v1.0.2...claude-code-worktree-paths-v2.0.0) (2026-05-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* removed the `repoSettings.gateEnvVar` setting. To disable the plugin in a specific project or on a specific machine, use Claude Code's native `enabledPlugins` setting instead.
